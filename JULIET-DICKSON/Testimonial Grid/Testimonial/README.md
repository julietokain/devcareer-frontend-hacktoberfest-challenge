# Frontend Mentor - Testimonials grid section

[The challenge]([Testimonial Grid challenge on Frontend Mentor)

I made this challenge with HTML and CSS, to make it mobile responsive I used media query, I used flex box to put the image and text side by side and used grid for the testimonial containers I got to learn about css grid.
