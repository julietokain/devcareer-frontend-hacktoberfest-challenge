# Frontend Mentor - Interactive rating component

![Design preview for the Interactive rating component coding challenge](./design/desktop-preview.jpg)



I made this challenge with HTML, CSS and JavaScript. To make it mobile responsive I used media query, I used css flex properties to arrange the container and also make it responsive. I got to learn about javaScript "style" and "this".
